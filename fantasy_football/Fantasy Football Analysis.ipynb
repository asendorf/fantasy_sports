    "Here, I calculate how lucky each team was based on the arbitrary schedule & rivalry week matchups. This is computed on a weekly basis and asks the question \"What if my opponent was different this week?\" The way that our league works, you are matched up with one opponent and play head-to-head against them for that week. If you score a lot of points, but end up playing the team that scored the most, that's pretty unlucky. If you score hardly any points, but end up playing the team that scored the least points, that's pretty lucky.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I want to evaluate\n",
    "a team's week-to-week variance. This is a slightly different luck analysis than the schedule analysis above. Instead of assuming that your score for the week is fixed and looking at who you played, this analysis will keep your opponent the same each week, but look at your scores for other weeks and see if you would have won. This asks the question \"What if my player's schedule was different?\". Again we'll compare the Expected wins to the actual wins but sort by expected wins. Some notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Generally speaking the expected wins don't deviate as strongly as the other luck analysis.\n",
    "  * After digging into things, I think this analysis correlates to points scored against. Because this analysis keeps your opponent the same every week, if your oppoent got really lucky week after week, even your good scores wouldn't have won a bunch.\n",
    "  * The top 4 stay the same with an interesting exception - Peter's Team jumps into the top 4. So while Peter's matchup on a weekly basis was lucky (previous analysis showed +2 wins over expected), this analysis reveals that Peter's Team had the lowest points scored against him.\n",
    "  * Also interestingly, Zach Attack only finishes 6th in this analysis even though he scored 2nd most points and would have finished 2nd in the luck analysis. This is likely due to the fact that he had the 2nd most points scored against him and so while his week-to-week scores were pretty good, he likely couldn't do much to overcome the brutal schedule.\n",
    "  * JBone! also does really poorly here and this reveals an interesting difference between him and Zach Attack. JBone! had the highest points scored against him and Zach Attack had the 2nd most - both really close. Zack Attack gains a few wins, while JBone! loses about 2.5. JBone! scored about 15 points less per week and so we'll see his score drop pretty significantly."
