# Fantasy Football Data Analysis

This repo contains scripts to analyze some fantasy football data. Back in graduate school,
I did most of this in MATLAB. Since then, I've recovered and transitioned over to python.

### Running
To run the analysis, first build and activate the conda environment
```
conda env create -f ff.yml
conda activate ff
```

### TODO
 - convert old data into python readable format
